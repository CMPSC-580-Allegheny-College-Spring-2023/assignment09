# Junior Seminar (CS580) Assignment 09

Retrospective: Reflect on the results of the experiments and identify improvements

**Assigned** : Thursday 13th April 2023

**Due** : Tuesday 18th April 2023

## Objectives

- Engage with a peer to reflect on the experiments you have conducted.
- Identify improvements to own project based on the experimental results.
- Be able to listen and understand peer's experimental study and suggest improvements to future experimental studies and the prototype.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

At this point in your project's evolution, you should have a well-defined research project, supported by literature, with a working and well-documented prototype that you have used to conduct an experimental study. Your experimental study should have included several experiments that you have run generating experimental results that you then used for analysis and discussion.

Now, we will take a moment to reflect on the results of your experiments, helping each other identify shortcomings and implications of the experiments. These points will be critical when we begin the writing focus of the project next week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview of Tasks

- **Part1**; Before the end of lab **TODAY**: Engage in a peer interview. The process should be as follows:

  - Each interviewee should give an overview of their project and the goals of their experimental study (follow the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` document's Part 1).
  - Each interviewee should explain to a peer what they learned from their experiments and what are the limitations (follow the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` document's Part 2).
  - Each interviewer should then ask questions to better understand implications of their peer's work (follow the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` document's Part 3). Then, interviewers must suggest improvements to their experimental study, prototype, or research direction in general.

- **Part2**; For class **Tuesday**: Complete the writing requirement.

  - Interviewee must complete the `writing/reflection.md` document answering all questions.
  - Interviewer must submit their suggestions for improvements to the project or new experiments to try as a GitHub issue in interviewee's repository. You must submit at least three (3) suggestions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary of Deliverables

- Complete your Markdown document: `writing/reflection.md`.
- At least one GitHub issue with suggestions for improvement in peer's repository.
- Update research notebook with notes from your conversation about your project.

## Project Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 10%]:**: For the repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct running of the program. An additional reduction will given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Evaluation [up to 30%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the GitHub issue they create in peer's repository reveal a proficiency of technical evaluation of someone else's project. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted GitHub issue should have at least three suggestions for improvement that are relevant and beneficial to the project at hand. Additionally, the GitHub issue should have the correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate suggestions.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 60%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflections.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

- Do not forget to use the above git commands to push your work to the cloud for the instructor to grade your assignment. You can go to your GitHub repository using your browser to verify that your files have been submitted. Please see the TL's or the instructor if you have any questions about assignment submission.

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
